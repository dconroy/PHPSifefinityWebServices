Create News and Events Item in Sitefinity for PHP Developers

This set of files is intended to provide small working examples of Sitefinity's Web Service API written in PHP.
The examples strive to be simple, well documented and modification friendly to help
developers quickly learn their inner workings, with a little reading and hands on experience.

To get started, fill out your credentials in admin.php and then navigate login.php.

After that, use to createNews.php and createEvents.php to create/print out each respective item.

All examples use WCF/PHP/cURL.

If you find a problem, incorrect comment, obsolete or improper code or such,
please me know by emailing me at dconroy@gmail.com
